# DroidStar Web Demo #

This is written in [Elm][1].  To try it out, [install Elm][2] and
follow these steps:

    $ git clone https://github.com/cuplv/droidstar-demo
    $ cd droidstar-demo/client
    $ elm-reactor

The demo should now be live on `localhost:8000` (or whatever address
`elm-reactor` tells you).

The minimal setup implemented so far is based on the example usage
from the [`elm-typed-dropdown`][3] package
